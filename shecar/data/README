The datasets of all three experiments are given in three subfolders respectively.

Hand poses are given in text file with the file name containing "handposes". Every line of the text is a hand pose, the first nine numbers make up the orientation matrix with column major, i.e. 
	1  4  7
R=  2  5  8
    3  6  9
position is the last three numbers.

The ground truth of hand-eye calibration is given in text file with the name containing "ground truth", the format of ground truth is same to hand pose.

The intrinsic parameter of the camera used in monocular and griiper-camera experiments are given in file named "intrinsic.txt". where each line is in the form of:
     image_name focal_length ppx ppy aspect_ratio skew k1 k2
where ppx, ppy are the principal points of the image and k1, k2 are the two radial distortion parameters.

In synthetic data experiment, the 2-view matches are already estimated and saved to ".matches" files. ".matches" file is a binary file format defined in Theia.
